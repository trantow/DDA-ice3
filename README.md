# DDA-ice3

Density Dimension Algorithm for Ice Surfaces (python3)

## Introduction and References

The Density Dimension Algorithm for Ice (DDA-Ice) is designed to detect cryospheric signals in the photon data provided NASA's ICESat-2 satellite. The algorithm and its applications are described in the following manuscripts:

## Dependencies

The packages listed below are the only ones that will need to be installed in your python environment. The `scikit-learn` dependencies should cover all other necessary packages.

```diff
+ Python 3
+ h5py
+ json
+ scipy
+ numpy
+ shapely
+ matplotlib
+ optparse
+ utm
+ sklearn
```
> **Note:** Sometimes you will get a runtime error (OSError: Could not find lib geos_c.dll or load any of its variants []) when shapely is installed with conda. To fix it, you must 1) remove the conda version of shapely (conda uninstall shapely), 2) install the conda version of "geos" (conda install geos), 3) install shapely via pip (pip install shapely). You should not get this error anymore.

## Code

The DDA-ice code is built using python-3 and is most effeciently run using a bash script. The code in this repository is as follows:

**`DDA_main.py`**
This is the main python file for the DDA-ice code. It first parses the command line arguments into readable parameters and formats the output directories. This file also produces all logging information throughout execution of the code, and saves output data at specific locations.
<br></br>

**`DDA_func.py`**
This file defines all the *computation* functions for DDA-ice. They are functions like `load_photon_data`, `compute_density`, and `interpolate_ground`.
<br></br>

**`DDA_vis.py`**
This file contains all the *plotting* functions for DDA-ice. They are functions like `plot_raw_data`, `plot_density`, and `plot_ground_estimate`.
<br></br>

**`run_dda-ice.sh`**
This is the bash script which sets input parameters for the python code and calls the python code with these parameters passed in as command line arguments. Three standard parameter sets (`weak_beam_params`, `simplGreen_params`, and `double_dens_params`) are all included at the top of the shell script for convenience. Some of the parameters will still need to be changed regularly: `fp`, `ch`, `runname`, `tstart`, and `tend`.

## Input Data

The DDA-ice takes the ATL03 Global Geolocated Photon Data from ICESat-2 as input, which is in HDF5 format. Data can be downloaded after making a free account at https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/. It is best to downsample the data using the variables **`time-start`**, **`time-end`**, **`track-start`** and/or **`track-end`** in order for run times to be reasonable.

## Output
DDA-ice-py3 will create a folder in the current directory called `output/<runname>/` which will contain everything generated during runtime (including the log file). `output/<runname>/plots` will contain all plots generated during runtime.
